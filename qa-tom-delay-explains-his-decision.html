Joining the discussion were his campaign manager, Chris Homan, and his House press secretary, Shannon Flaherty.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Thank you for sitting down with TIME. I understand you’re going to be making an announcement soon. Could you tell us about that?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> After the primary [March 7], I started looking at—reevaluating the primary—evaluating what the general election was going to be, looking at the landscape. I spent a lot of time talking to friends and people I have respect for and staff—Christine and I every day discussing what the future holds. And I’m very proud of my record and I feel very strongly about what the 22nd District that I represent deserves. I spent a lot of time in prayer. It was obvious to me—I’m a realist. I’ve been around awhile. I can evaluate political situations. And it was obvious to me that the 22nd District needed an election that discussed issues. It was obvious to me that this election had become a referendum on me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And although I felt, I feel that I could have won the race, I just felt like I didn’t want to risk the seat and that I can do more on the outside of the House than I can on the inside right now. I want to continue to fight for the conservative cause. I want to continue to work for a Republican majority. It’s obvious to me over the last few months, I have tremendous support, not just in the 22nd District. I mean, when I say “tremendous support,” I’m talking about people who strongly support me and are emotional about what we’ve been fighting for and what we’ve been working for. And I have felt that support around the country, too, and in Washington, D.C. I feel very close to the Members and have a great relationship with the members. And I’m looking at being focused right here in this district, fighting a referendum on me, versus being able to go out and work for the conservative cause and the Republican majority. It just became obvious that that’s what I needed to do.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I made a speech last week, and that pretty much cinched it for me. A good friend of mine, Dr. Rick Scarborough, who started—and I urged him, and we’ve worked together over the years—an organization called Vision America, which is out recruiting pastors to get involved in the political arena. He asked me to come speak. He was having a conference on the war on Christianity. So I made a speech on Wednesday. It was covered by C-Span and, frankly, a bunch of cameras. I felt very good, very free about giving that speech. The reaction was incredible—just an outpouring of love and support from the audience. It was probably the one single event that convinced me: I can DO this. I could keep fighting for the things I believe in, outside of Congress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> What was it that made you feel free, and what was your main point?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b>My main point was that this country was built on morals and religion. Our greatest leaders were very strong believers. There is a connection between religion and politics, and religion and government. There has to be for this country to have accomplished all it’s accomplished and for its future. How many times have the great leaders—Ronald Reagan, Roosevelt, Lincoln, George Washington—have said there is a connection between morals and religion. And there has to be. The people that go to church understand that a country has to be based on some sort of religion and fear of God because they understand that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> They’re accountable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Yeah. If you know that we’re all sinners, then you know that we have to work hard to have a moral foundation. So I felt very liberated in being able to say that. I didn’t have to worry about being the spokesman for the Republican Party and all that kind of stuff.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> Plus, they were all your friends.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Well, most of ’em knew who I was—they knew who I was. (Both DeLays chuckle)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> There was QUITE a chunk of that Chris Matthews’ show.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Oh, they did? Hmm.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> What are your immediate plans? Could you talk to me about the timeline?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> I’m going to announce tomorrow [Tuesday] that I’m not running for reelection and that I’m going to leave Congress sometime—I haven’t figured out because I have some things to do, to finish. I’m working very hard on the President’s vision for NASA and that’s incredibly important for the nation, as well as this district. I’m working on some district things. I hope to get through those things as fast as possible. But it’ll take a couple months. So I don’t know exactly the date. I’ll probably come up with a date in the next couple weeks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Less than 60 days? Sometime in May?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b>Probably the end of May. But it depends on the Congressional schedule. As far as what happens with my spot on the ballot: The state Republican executive committee will go to work and I will move to Virginia. The state Republican election committee will pick someone to run on this ballot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> What is it about the law that makes your moving to Virginia important?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b>I become ineligible to run for election if I’m not a resident of the state of Texas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Where in Virginia?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b>I own, I live in a condo in Alexandria.

We’re going to lay it out. We will send a [videotaped] speech to all the media outlets. We will send a letter to my district through e-mail and otherwise we will send a letter to the members explaining why I’m doing what I’m doing, and that’ll be that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Could you talk about the period of time over which you considered this decision?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> I don’t know that you can put it in a period of time. I’ve been fighting this strategy of personal destruction for going on 10 years. I’m not whining. The Democrats even publicly announced that they were going to destroy my reputation and an effort to do that. So I guess when I got indicted in September—I’m a realist, and I know politics. I have been fighting this effort for a long time, and we were continuing to fight it. We knew that the indictments were frivolous. Being indicted under laws that don’t exist is frivolous. But we thought that we could get to court in December. Obviously, [Travis County, Tex., District Attorney]Ronnie Earle’s strategy is to drag it out past the November election. That’s QUITE obvious now. You live it day by day and you fight it day by day. It didn’t work out. The Abramoff stuff hit with [former lobbyist] Jack Abramoff’s pleading guilty in January. It was obvious—more obvious than that, and not because of that, the [House] leadership had to be in place before we started this year. So I stepped down as Majority Leader [as required under caucus rules when a leader is indicted] because I wanted to make sure they had a leadership. While that’s going on, I’m in the middle of a primary. We won the primary. We took another look—</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> Sixty-two percent!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> We took another look at the general election, and then it became quite evident that I had to start seriously focusing on what the future should be, and what it was going to be. I think I was really focused on whether to retire or not right after the primary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> I understand you got a poll recently that had pretty tough news.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> We had just run a primary. We had a poll coming out in December that showed we were in decent shape but the district was quite polarized. There was very small undecided. And fortunately there were more supporting me than against me. But my support was incredibly strong. My opposition was also incredibly strong.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> Yeah, but not for the man.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Against me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> Against Tom.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Exactly. (Both DeLays chuckle.) I had more for me than against me. We did a poll right after the primary and it hadn’t changed very much. The trends were still very tight and very close. I had a little bit better than a 50-50 chance of winning reelection. I had a great campaign manager that had done—actually, if you look at what we had done in the primary, we had a record turnout here. Why? Because we—Chris Homan and my campaign staff— had identified more pro-Tom DeLay voters than the parties had projected the vote. And so we turned those vote and therefore helped the turnout. We could have done that again.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> It was around 50-50, so you might have lost.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Could have. There’s no reason to risk a seat. This is a very strong Republican district. It’s obvious to me that anybody but me running here will overwhelmingly win the seat. This had become a referendum on me. So it’s better for me to step aside and let it be a referendum on ideas, Republican values and what’s important for this district.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Is the candidate likely to be one of the other three Republicans from the primary?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> No. (Smiles)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Who’s the candidate likely to be?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> We’ve got some really great elected officials here—state reps, state senators, local and county judges.

[Oaks at] Rio Bend [a residence for foster children planned by a DeLay-controlled charity] is not completed yet. We want to complete it, and hopefully it will be a model we can take around the country—around the state and around the country—to show that government can’t raise children, that people raise children and we have a way of giving foster children, abused and neglected children a safe, permanent home.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> Whether you say this or not, I just want to you to know: We need more press on Rio Bend—the idea; not Tom DeLay. We didn’t name it, “Tom and Christine’s Little Home for Children.” It’s “Rio Bend,” just like a regular place.

It’s part of—I have learned how to make major decisions. I think the real major decision I had to make like this was whether to run for Speaker or not, when Newt [Gingrich] stepped aside. ’98, wasn’t it? It was quite obvious that’s not what I was supposed to be doing, and I felt very good about it. There’s many reasons why I shouldn’t have been Speaker. Not to sound arrogant, but I could have walked in, and I could have been Speaker. But at the time, we had foster kids. Christine would have to move, and we’d have to give up our foster kids. And I was not going to be Speaker unless Christine was living in Washington with me. You can’t commute and be Speaker. It’s just, it’s too hard. And for many other reasons—being nuclear, and so forth. I’d just been the main guy who [chuckles] impeached Bill Clinton and all that other stuff.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Christine DeLay:</b> It was the right decision.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> It was exactly the right decision. And the same thing here. Took a little longer here. I felt there right at the beginning that I was supposed to go through this. But that wasn’t what was going on. And what was going on was I had to be realistic and realistically look at it and then come to a decision. That I feel very good about.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> You said you prayed about it?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Oh, yeah. Ohhhh, yeah. (Chuckles) I spent a LOT of time praying about. When you have to make these kinds of decisions, you have to feel at peace with them. And if you have doubts, then it’s not the right decision. And so you talk to a lot of people, give a lot of people opportunities to give you messages. And listen—you have to be very sensitive to listen for those messages. And then evaluate them and wait patiently for things to unfold. And in the end, feel good about it. Door’s open. If it’s the wrong decision, doors don’t open—they’re closed to you, and you don’t feel good about it, and you have doubts. Doors are opening already. People are already talking about things I can do. People that I have talked to have come back to me and said: Look, I’m involved in x, y and z. Maybe you can help me do that kind of stuff politically. So doors are opening and there is no doubt in my mind that this is the right decision. And feel very much at peace.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b>You mentioned foster care and public speaking.

All I know is that’s what my world view is. I want to get rid of this tax code and replace it with a fair tax—national sales tax. That would be a revolution in this country. We will return to an economic leader. It would cause people to move back to the United States in order to do business. We can double the economy in 10 years, if we just get rid of our tax code. The American family’s under attack, the culture war is going on. I’ve been fighting that and I will continue to fight that, whether it be trying to defend marriage. As Majority Leader, I was the guy who started the whole effort to thwart judicial activism, to hold the judiciary accountable. We passed six bills limiting the jurisdiction of the courts. We passed, twice, the breakup of the 9th Circuit [for federal appeals]. We’ve worked to change the brainwashing of law schools back to the Constitution, and convince people once again that there are three branches of government. There’s not an ivory tower, all wisdom does not reside in nine people with black robes, and Congress has a responsibility given to it by the Constitution to hold the executive branch and the judicial branch accountable.

He would go to door to door to each freshman. He’d come in and talk to you and invite you to a Bible study and show you a James Dobson video called, “Where’s Daddy?” And every bad thing that he was talking about was me. And it really got my attention and it had a profound impact on me, made me really look at who I was and what I was doing. I started going to that Bible study.

He’s done it before, against all his political enemies, Democrats or Republicans. It is outrageous. It has had a direct impact on the future of this state and the future of the Houston-Galveston area. When you have the Majority Leader that passed the sales-tax deductibility in Texas, that got Texas 92 cents for every dollar of highway money [sent to Washington], which is $788 million more a year than what they’d been doing, when he has been able to fully fund NASA against all comers, including the Senate.

What we did—no, actually what TRMPAC [Texans for a Republican Majority, a political action committee founded by DeLay] did was consistent with what has been done by the Democrats as well as the Republicans for years. They took moneys that were legally raised from corporate interests that was more than they could use, sent that money—corporate funds and soft moneys—to the Republican National Committee so that they could take those funds and put them in states that accepted, legally, corporate funds for campaigns. And the Republican Party is supposed to—it’s supposed to participate in the elections in the state of Texas, and they did. There was no quid pro quo. There was no exchange of funds.

The reason we’ve been effective is we’ve tried to change the culture of Washington, D.C. And do it legally and ethically. The Democrats hate the fact that their culture of K Street has been changed from a totally dominated Democrat K Street [lobbying community]to a totally dominated Republican K Street. Nothing illegal about that at all. And we built that. When we took over in 1995, the K Street contributions to elections was 70/30—70 percent Democrat, 30 percent Republican.

When you’re in a leadership position, you have to hire people that you trust and 99.9 percent of the people that have worked for me are strong, solid, wonderful people that believe in what we’re doing. And my management style is we move forward and I rely on people to do their job the best way they know how without me doing a President Carter oversight.

I hope that people will look at what we’ve been able to accomplish, regardless of what they did. The advancement of the conservative agenda, we’ve been able to turn around the left’s agenda over the last 11 years.

That’s going to where people are. When you go and you speak to a group, they usually are not meeting in Clute, Texas. Their meetings are in resorts that they have chosen—not what I have chosen. My trips are all for legitimate reason and I was very much involved in advancing the conservative agenda overseas—whether it’s working against Christian persecution in China or advancing the conservative cause in England with Margaret Thatcher or pushing freedom and democracy in Moscow or getting persecuted Jews out of the Soviet Union, or fighting Communists and socialists in Central America. When you go to those places, you are with the people that you’re meeting with. You’re staying in the hotels that you meet in. You can’t prove to me one thing that I have done for my own personal game. Yes, I play golf. I’m very proud of the fact that I play golf. It’s the only thing that I do for myself. And when you go to a country and you’re there for seven days and you take an afternoon off to play golf, what does the national media write? All about the golf, not about the meeting that you went to. I’m not ashamed of anything I’ve done. I’ve never done anything in my political career for my own personal gain. You can look at my bank account and my house to understand that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Campaign Manager Chris Homan:</b> Ninety percent of his travel during this timeframe that everybody keeps talking about was for raising money for Republican parties, Republican candidates, Republican causes.

I think did about 89 districts the whole year. If I’d done it by private plane, I could have tripled the number of districts. And that’s why we started using private planes, instead of going commercial and doing one event in one district per day, you can hit three districts in one day. And you can really knock ’em out doing what is important, and that is electing conservatives to Congress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> The campaign finance group Political Moneyline discovered that you’d used an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco plane to go to your arraignment. I know that’s perfectly legal.

There’s nothing wrong with it. They had a plane available. My schedule was such that I couldn’t do it commercially—that I had to get up there and then get back and do my job. And that’s the only plane that was available at the time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> Your smiling mug shot—what made you think of that and what do you think the consequence of that has been?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Oh, I don’t know. I said a little prayer. First of all, you only get one take. It’s a very humiliating thing, to be booked. And I said a little prayer before I actually did the fingerprint thing, and the picture. And my prayer was basically: “Let people see Christ through me. And let me smile.” Now, when they took the shot, from my side, I thought it was fakiest smile I’d ever given. But through the camera, it was glowing. I mean, it had the right impact. Poor old left couldn’t use it at all. They had all kind of things planned, they’d spent a lot of money. It made me feel kind of good that all those plans went down the toilet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> So what would you do differently?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Nothing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> My last question is a two-part question: What do you THINK your legacy will be, and what would you LIKE your legacy to be?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Well, first of all, I’m incredibly proud of the 22nd District, that is a conservative Republican district that has allowed me to advance the conservative agenda and build the Republican Party. I think that, probably, is the legacy. I’m not dead yet, so the legacy is still in the making. And I’m very proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish, particularly in the time of the majority. And I’m kind of excited about what the future holds and continuing to work for those issues, that world view and that political party.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>TIME:</b> But you’ll be known for some things that you don’t want to be known for?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>DeLay:</b> Only by people that I don’t care about.
