The <a href=#>decision</a> by the United States to drop the world’s first atomic weapons on two Japanese cities—Hiroshima first, on Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later—was that rare historical moment that requires little hindsight to gain its significance. World War II would end, and the Cold War soon begin. New frontiers of science were opening, along with new and frightening moral questions. As TIME <a href=#>noted</a> in the week following the bombings, the men aboard the Enola Gay could only summon two words: “My God!”</p><p>But, even as world leaders and ordinary citizens alike immediately began <a href=#>struggling</a> to process the metaphorical aftershocks, one specific set of people had to face something else. For the <a href=#>survivors</a> of those ruined cities, the coming of the bomb was a personal event before it was a global one. Amid the death and destruction, some combination of luck or destiny or smarts saved them—and therefore saved the voices that can still tell the world what it looks like when human beings find new and terrible ways to destroy one another.</p><p>Today, photographer Haruka Sakaguchi is seeking out those individuals, asking them to give a testimony about what they lived through and to write a message to future generations. As the anniversaries of the bombings approach once again, here is a <a href=#>selection</a> of that work.</p><p></p><p style=text-align:center;color:#d00000;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:700;font-size:23px;letter-spacing:2.4px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:-20px>Yasujiro Tanaka<br><span style=color:#566573;font-size:12.5px;letter-spacing:2px;line-height:80%>age:<span style=color:#d00000> 75</span> / location:<span style=color:#d00000> nagasaki</span> / DISTANCE from hypocenter:<span style=color:#d00000> 3.4 km</span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/atomic-bomb-survivors-haruka-sakaguchi-037.jpg><p style=text-transform:uppercase;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;color:#566573;letter-spacing:3px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px>TRANSLATION</p><p><span style=color:#566573;margin-top:-20px>“You are only given One life, So cherish this moment Cherish this day, Be kind to others, Be kind to yourself”</span></p><p style=text-transform:uppercase;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;color:#000;letter-spacing:3px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px>TESTIMONY</p><p>“I was three years old at the time of the bombing. I don’t remember much, but I do recall that my surroundings turned blindingly white, like a million camera flashes going off at once.</p><p>Then, pitch darkness.</p><p>I was buried alive under the house, I’ve been told. When my uncle finally found me and pulled my tiny three year old body out from under the debris, I was unconscious. My face was misshapen. He was certain that I was dead.</p><p>Thankfully, I survived. But since that day, mysterious scabs began to form all over my body. I lost hearing in my left ear, probably due to the air blast.

All I can do is pray – earnestly, relentlessly – for world peace.”<br></p><p></p><p style=text-align:center;color:#d00000;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:700;font-size:23px;letter-spacing:2.4px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:-20px>Inosuke Hayasaki<br><span style=color:##d00000;font-size:12.5px;letter-spacing:2px;line-height:80%>86 <span style=color:#566573>/</span> nagasaki <span style=color:#566573>/</span> 1.1 km</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/atomic-bomb-survivors-haruka-sakaguchi-043.jpg><p style=text-transform:uppercase;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;color:#566573;letter-spacing:3px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px>TRANSLATION</p><p><span style=color:#566573;margin-top:-20px>“I am very thankful for the opportunity to meet with you and speak with you about world peace and the implications of the atom bomb.</span></p><p><span style=color:#566573>I, Hayasaki, have been deeply indebted to the Heiwasuishinkyokai for arranging this meeting, amongst many other things. You have traveled far from the US – how long and arduous your journey must have been. Seventy two years have passed since the bombing – alas, young people of this generation have forgotten the tragedies of war and many pay no mind to the Peace Bell of Nagasaki. Perhaps this is for the better, an indication that the current generation revels in peace. Still, whenever I see people of my own generation join their hands before the Peace Bell, my thoughts go out to them.</span></p><p><span style=color:#566573>May the citizens of Nagasaki never forget the day when 74,000 people were instantaneously turned into dust. Currently, it seems Americans have a stronger desire for peace than us Japanese. During the war, we were told that the greatest honor was to die for our country and be laid to rest at the Yasukuni Shrine.</span></p><p><span style=color:#566573>We were told that we should not cry but rejoice when family members died in the war effort. We could not utter a single word of defiance to these cruel and merciless demands; we had no freedoms. In addition, the entire country was starving – not a single treat or needle to be seen at the department store. A young child may beg his mother for a snack but she could do nothing – can you imagine how tormenting that is to a mother?</span></p><p style=text-transform:uppercase;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;color:#000;letter-spacing:3px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px>TESTIMONY</p><p>“The injured were sprawled out over the railroad tracks, scorched and black. When I walked by, they moaned in agony. ‘Water… water…’</p><p>I heard a man in passing announce that giving water to the burn victims would kill them. I was torn. I knew that these people had hours, if not minutes, to live. These burn victims – they were no longer of this world.</p><p>‘Water… water…’</p><p>I decided to look for a water source. Luckily, I found a futon nearby engulfed in flames. I tore a piece of it off, dipped it in the rice paddy nearby, and wrang it over the burn victims’ mouths. There were about 40 of them. I went back and forth, from the rice paddy to the railroad tracks. They drank the muddy water eagerly. Among them was my dear friend Yamada. ‘Yama- da! Yamada!’ I exclaimed, giddy to see a familiar face. I placed my hand on his chest. His skin slid right off, exposing his flesh. I was mortified. ‘Water…’<span class=marker></span> he murmured. I wrang the water over his mouth. Five minutes later, he was dead.</p><p>In fact, most of the people I tended to were dead.</p><p>I cannot help but think that I killed those burn victims. What if I hadn’t given them water? Would many of them have lived? I think about this everyday.”</p><p>We would not be where we are today if it weren’t for the countless lives that</p><p>were lost due to the bombing, and the many survivors who have lived in pain and struggle since. We cannot shatter this momentum of peace – it is priceless. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers died under the insurmountable greed of the Japanese military elite class. We cannot forget those young soldiers who silently longed for their parents, yearned for their wives and children as they passed away amidst the chaos of war. American soldiers have faced similar hardships. We must cherish peace, even if it leaves us poor. The smile pales when peace is taken from us. Wars of today no longer yield winners and losers – we all become losers, as our habitats become inhabitable. We must remember that our happiness today is built upon the hopes and dreams of those that passed before us.</p><p>Japan is a phenomenal country – however, we must be cognizant of the fact that we waged war on the US, and received aid from them afterwards. We must be cognizant of the pain that we inflicted upon our neighbors during the war. Fa- vors and good deeds are often forgotten, but trauma and misdeeds are passed on from one generation to the other – such is the way the world works. The ability to live in peace is a country’s most prized commodity. I pray that Japan continues to be a shining example of peace and harmony. I pray that this message resonates with young people all over the globe. Please excuse my handwriting.<br></p><p></p><p style=text-align:center;color:#d00000;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:700;font-size:23px;letter-spacing:2.4px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:-20px>Ryouga Suwa<br><span style=color:##d00000;font-size:12.5px;letter-spacing:2px;line-height:80%>84 <span style=color:#566573>/</span> hiroshima <span style=color:#566573>/</span> entered the affected area after the bombing and was exposed to radiation</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/atomic-bomb-survivors-haruka-sakaguchi-041.jpg><p style=text-transform:uppercase;font-size:16px;font-weight:700;color:#566573;letter-spacing:3px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;margin-top:20px>TRANSLATION</p><p><span style=color:#566573;margin-top:-20px>“Within the Buddhist vernacular, there is a bird called the gumyouchou.

The original Johoji Temple was within 500m of the hypocenter.

Hiroshima was a flat wasteland. I remember feeling shocked that I could make out the Setonai Islands in the distance, which used to be inhibited by buildings.</p><p>In 1951, the temple was relocated to its current address. The new Johoji was rebuilt by the hands of our supporters and thrived along with the eventual revival of Hiroshima City. We practice an anti-war and anti-nuclear weapons philosophy here and have partnered with the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park every year to coordinate lectures and events and pursue hibaku building restoration projects.”<br></p><p style=text-align:center><span style=font-size:15px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;color:#000;letter-spacing:.1em;text-transform:uppercase;line-height:10px><a href=#><strong>Haruka Sakaguchi</strong></a> is a photographer based in New york City<br></span></p><p style=text-align:center><span style=font-size:15px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;color:#000;letter-spacing:.1em;text-transform:uppercase;line-height:10px><strong>Paul Moakley</strong>, who edited this photo essay, is time‘s Deputy Director of Photography<br></span></p><p style=text-align:center><span style=font-size:15px;font-family:franklin-gothic-urw,sans-serif;color:#000;letter-spacing:.1em;text-transform:uppercase;line-height:10px><strong>Lily Rothman</strong> is time‘s <span class="text font-secondary size-medium">History and Archives Editor</span><br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaanqSav27Ax55km6edl3w%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fafter-the-bomb.html&title=Survivors%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki%20Share%20Their%20Stories" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fafter-the-bomb.html&description=Survivors%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki%20Share%20Their%20Stories" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fafter-the-bomb.html&title=Survivors%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki%20Share%20Their%20Stories" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fafter-the-bomb.html&title=Survivors%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki%20Share%20Their%20Stories" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fafter-the-bomb.html&text=Survivors%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki%20Share%20Their%20Stories" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fafter-the-bomb.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Larita Shotwell</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-07-24</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./titanic-captain-failed-his-exam-in-navigation-816174.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Titanic Captain Failed His Exam in Navigation</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./meet-carmen-dellorefice-91-whose-modeling-career-has-been-unstoppable-for-more-than-70-years-809503.html><h3>Meet Carmen DellOrefice, 91, Whose Modeling Career Has Been Unstoppable for More Than 70 Years >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
